# PDF-GENERATOR
@ work, need to generate documents in pdf in a way to treat orders of toner without human action

It's my first personnal program in java.
I know he doesn't respect OO correctly, no exception managment too, some actions can be perfected and he don't follow Liskov laws.

When it will be possible, i will rework it according theses to make it correct.
